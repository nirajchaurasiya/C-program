# Coffee Machine

Author: Niraj Chaurasiya
Programmed Date: July 17, 2023

## Description

The "Coffee Machine" project aims to mimic a real-world coffee machine that provides coffee automatically to its customers. It is a C programming project that demonstrates the functionality of a coffee machine.

Initially, the project may seem challenging, but it is actually a straightforward project. It offers 5 options divided into two types: coffee types and system settings.

### Coffee Types

The coffee types further classify into three basic options: latte, cappuccino, and espresso. To order one of these options, the user needs to input the type of coffee in the console. The program checks the availability of ingredients and asks the user to enter the denomination of notes (5 Rs, 10 Rs, and 20 Rs). If the entered money is equal to or more than the actual cost of the coffee, the coffee is ordered with any extra money returned as change. If there are not enough ingredients available, a message "There are not enough ingredients available right now" is displayed. If the ingredients are available but the entered money is less than the actual cost, the entered money is refunded.

### System Settings

The system settings include generating reports of ingredient status, selling coffee, and turning off the machine. Entering "off" deactivates the machine, while entering "report" displays the current reports of the machine's status.

## Getting Started

To run the Coffee Machine project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the project files.
3. Compile the source code using your C compiler.
4. Run the compiled executable file.
5. Follow the instructions in the console to interact with the Coffee Machine.
